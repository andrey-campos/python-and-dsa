# Python Data Structures & Algorithms

A comprehensive collection of Python implementations and explanations for fundamental data structures and algorithms, designed for computer science and mathematics students preparing for technical interviews and coursework.

## What's Inside

### Core Data Structures
- **Dynamic Arrays & String Manipulation** - Efficient approaches to array operations and string handling
- **Linked Lists** - Singly and doubly linked list implementations with traversal algorithms
- **Hash Tables** - Sets, maps, and collision resolution techniques
- **Stacks & Queues** - LIFO/FIFO implementations using arrays and deques
- **Binary Trees & BSTs** - Tree traversal (DFS/BFS), search operations, and balanced tree properties
- **Heaps & Priority Queues** - Min/max heap implementations and heap sort

### Essential Algorithms
- **Recursion & Call Stacks** - Base cases, recursive patterns for trees and linked lists
- **Binary Search** - Traditional and condition-based approaches
- **Sorting Algorithms** - Bubble sort, insertion sort, and quicksort implementations
- **Graph Algorithms** - DFS/BFS traversal with adjacency lists and matrices

### Problem-Solving Patterns
- **Two Pointers** - Fast/slow pointers and left/right pointer techniques
- **Sliding Window** - Fixed and variable window size problems
- **Hash Maps & Sets** - Frequency counting and lookup optimizations
